I'm Jonathan Singer, a Computer Science and Math student, with particular interest in low level optimization and operating systems and security, as well as distributed systems, and I have previous experience working on the Linux kernel over a summer internship at Google. I have done research on systems security and come August will be working full time on distributed filesystems.

### More Information

During this course, I am interested in contributing more to the Linux kernel.
